# HART HEALTH AND FITNESS

This project is to build a HTML/CSS website for HART Health and Fitness solely for advertisement. Owner of HART (Joe Morgan) has recently moved to Copenhagan, Denmark and is trying to establish his brand overseas. 
In his time in Denmark he has managed to form a good client base through word of mouth.
The website is designed to increase knowledge of the brand and services on offer, and hopefully generate this into further clients and business.
The website provides a short background of the brand, the services offered, reviews from current clients, common questions and finally a contact form to register interest of services.


### UX

The website has been created for Joe Morgan, Owner of HART Health and Fitness. The website is designed to provide advertising and generate further business and spread knowledge of the brand.
The website concisely provides all relevant information on the brand, services offered, positive reviews of Joe's services and a contact form.
